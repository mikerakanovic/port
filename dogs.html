              <div> Moe is a very good dog, however he used to be a little terror growing up.  If i left him alone he would pull all the cushions off the couch and
                and try to rip them apart.  He was very spiteful and enjoyed to stare at me in the eye while he was peeing on the carpet.  However, after his first 2-3 years
                he started to become a sweet boy that did not want to cause any trouble and only give love.  Since then hes been the goodest boy amd enjoys to cuddle!

              <img class="img-fluid" src="#"/>
              <div> Lou is still not even 2 yet, so he is still in his terror stage.  Unlike Moe was as a young dog, Lou instead likes to leave 3-coil steamers in the middle of the floor.
                When we come back, our home will usually smells like a sewage plant. When we are home however, he can be a really good boy and never goes to the washroom inside.  He will usually
                let us know when he has to go.  With all that aside, Lou also likes to cuddle and is incredibly affectionate.
